# 👋 Hi, I'm hfu

I'm an engineer passionate about geospatial technology and international development ❤️‍🔥

💙 I started co-charing the UN Open GIS Initiative since July 2025. 
🗺️ I lead the UN Smart Maps Group, the seventh domain working group under the UN Open GIS Initiative.  
🚀 I also lead the Quick Mapping Project, a collaboration between JICA and OpenStreetMap.  
🧩 I specialize in vector tiles and portable, distributed mapping, such as UNVT POD.  
🌐 I serve as Senior Advisor on Geospatial Information for JICA. I have supported 12+ international development projects.

💡 **Favorite technologies:**
- PMTiles
